# CALT
Contour-Aware Long-term Tracking with Reliable Re- detection(TCSVT)

Code for the CALT proposed in the paper Contour-Aware Long-term Tracking with Reliable Re- detection

***----CALT-------****

The CALT tracker is based on the MCCT-H and Staple, The tracker with hand-crafted features is in the file CALT.
