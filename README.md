# CALT
Contour-Aware Long-term Tracking with Reliable Re-detection(TCSVT)

Code for the CALT proposed in the paper Contour-Aware Long-term Tracking with Reliable Re- detection

***----CALT master-------***

The CALT tracker is based on the MCCT-H and Staple, The tracker with hand-crafted features is in the sub file CALT master.
just start Matlab and run the runTracker.m.

***----Example：integrating proposed re-detection module into some other DCF based trackers-------***

Example: MCCT-H(CVPR2018), Staple(CVPR2016),DSST(BMVC2014).
this part will come soon!
